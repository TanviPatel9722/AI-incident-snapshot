    "**What it is:**\n",
    "- A curated, documented collection of AI-related incidents and reporting artifacts.\n",
    "- Useful for identifying broad patterns in incident types, harms, and failure modes.\n",
    "- Useful for transparency and reproducible policy-facing analytics.\n",

    "- A complete census of all AI harms.\n",
    "- A measurement of true prevalence of incidents across sectors.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key limitations and risks of misinterpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection and reporting bias**\n",
    "   - Incidents included depend on discoverability, media coverage, and monitoring.\n",
    "   - Certain regions or sectors may be under-represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Taxonomy coverage differences**\n",
    "   - MIT coverage is higher than GMF and CSET.\n",
    "   - Deep technical patterns may not generalize to all incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Schema variation across snapshots**\n",
    "   - Column naming and completeness can differ between exports.\n",
    "   - Notebooks therefore use defensive column detection and explicit assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Temporal ambiguity**\n",
    "   - Incident dates and report publication dates measure different events.\n",
    "   - Reporting lag can only be approximated on subset joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Responsible usage guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate:\n",
    "- Macro-level descriptive trends (domains, intent, failure types)\n",
    "- Transparency reporting and hypothesis generation\n",
    "- Reproducible policy-facing analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Not appropriate:\n",
    "- Ranking organizations as most harmful\n",
    "- Making causal claims about architectures or actors\n",
    "- Estimating true global incidence rates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility commitments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebooks run top-to-bottom with shared configuration and reusable helpers.\n",
    "- Outputs are saved to `outputs/figures/` and key tables are exportable.\n",
    "- Limitations are explicitly documented next to findings."
