## Assumptions
- Incidents are reported post-hoc; absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
- Classifications are human-labeled and may be inconsistent across annotators.
- Missing labels (e.g., "All Others") may reflect incomplete annotation, not true absence.

## Limitations
- Reporting bias (media + language + region).
- Survivorship bias (near-misses often not recorded).
- Uneven taxonomy coverage (MIT covers more incidents than CSET/GMF in many snapshots).
- Responsibility attribution is imperfect (AI vs human vs "other").
- Temporal skew (older incidents may be underrepresented or less detailed).
